    <h3>Early life</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Morphy was born in New Orleans to a wealthy and distinguished family. Morphy grew up in an atmosphere of gentle civility and culture where chess and music were the typical highlights of a Sunday home gathering.
      </li>
      <li>No one formally taught Morphy how to play chess; rather, Morphy learned on his own as a young child simply from watching others play
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chess Career</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Morphy learned chess at the age of 10.
      </li>
      <li>In 1850, when Morphy was twelve, he defeated strong professional Hungarian chess master Johann LÃ¶wenthal when he visited New Orleans.</li>
      <li>After winning the first American chess championship tournament at New York City in 1857, he traveled to Europe, where he defeated Adolf Anderssen of Germany, then unofficial world champion, and every other master who would face him.
      </li>
      <li>In Paris, at a banquet held in his honor on April 4, 1859, a laurel wreath was placed over the head of a bust of Morphy and was declared by the assembly "the best chess player that ever lived.
      </li>
      <li>So dominant was Morphy that even masters could not seriously challenge him in play without some kind of handicap.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Abandonment of chess
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>He returned to the United States in 1859 and issued a challenge, offering to face any player in the world at odds of pawn and move.
      </li>
      <li>When there was no response, Morphy abandoned his public chess career.
      </li>
      <li>After an unsuccessful attempt to practice law, he gradually withdrew into a life of seclusion, marked by eccentric behaviour and delusions of persecution.
      </li>
      <li>On the afternoon of July 10, 1884, Morphy was found dead in his bathtub in New Orleans at the age of 47. According to the autopsy, Morphy had suffered a stroke brought on by entering cold water after a long walk in the midday heat
      </li>
    </ul>
